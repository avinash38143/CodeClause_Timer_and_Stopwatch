Timer and Stopwatch Project: A Java Implementation
In this project, I have developed a Timer and Stopwatch application using Java programming language. The purpose of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable tool for time management and tracking in various scenarios.

Timer Functionality:
The timer functionality allows users to set a specific duration and count down until it reaches zero. It provides features like start, pause, and reset, enabling users to track time efficiently. This functionality proves useful for tasks requiring time-bound activities, such as cooking, studying, or workout sessions.

Stopwatch Functionality:
The stopwatch functionality allows users to measure the elapsed time accurately. It includes features like start, stop, and lap time recording. Users can use the stopwatch to track the duration of activities, such as sports events, competitions, or any situation where precise timekeeping is crucial.

User-Friendly Interface:
To enhance the user experience, I have implemented a user-friendly graphical interface using Java's Swing library. The interface provides intuitive buttons and displays to control and view the timer and stopwatch functionalities. It allows users to interact with the application easily and monitor time effectively.

Customization and Flexibility:
This project offers customization options, allowing users to adjust the timer duration or set different modes for the stopwatch, such as lap time or cumulative time. By incorporating these features, users can tailor the application to meet their specific requirements and preferences.

Precise Time Tracking:
The implementation ensures accurate time tracking by utilizing Java's Date and Time APIs. These APIs provide precise methods for measuring and calculating time intervals, ensuring reliable and consistent results.

Overall, this Timer and Stopwatch project in Java provides a robust and user-friendly solution for time management and tracking. It offers flexibility, customization, and accurate time measurements, making it a valuable tool for various time-bound activities.

There is two java file one is main file and another one is class file name of Stopwatch.java
